## üî¨‚ú® Research Collection on Autonomous AI for Scientific Discovery

### üåü Why This Collection Matters

Science thrives on curiosity, but idea to experiment pipelines are often slow.

This collection is a dynamic gateway to the latest research on **automated scientific discovery**. It includes breakthroughs in:

1. ‚öóÔ∏è Creative hypothesis generation  
2. ü§ñ Automated experimentation  
3. üìä Intelligent analysis  
4. üß† Continuous self-improvement  

> *No artificial caps: this list expands as the frontier shifts.*
